      I started with front-end tasks, coding the blade templates with HTML, CSS, Javascript and Jquery.
      I then took on more complex back-end tasks, such as vastly improving the electoral register upload speed and reliability, by converting them to queue jobs and writing pure SQL functions.
      The project uses Basecamp for Agile project management, GitLab for version control and we had scrum meetings on Teams.
      I also wrote Python/Geopandas code to extract geospatial data from the Ordinance Survey to pre-build addressing tables.

    description: After completing the MA in Creative Writing, I wrote two feature-length film scripts.
      I was part of an informal writers group in Brighton for seven years.
      We shared our writing, which could be any kind of fiction and reviewed each other's work.
      Members of the group included published novelists.
      It helped expand and sharpen my writing skills and led to two published works.
