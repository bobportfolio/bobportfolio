        <h4>Work Hours</h4>
        <p>
          Keeping timesheets for 18 months has given me a very good idea of my capabilities.
          I can sustain 37.5 hours a week (home working) and work up to a maximum 60 hours in any one week.
          When I am in the "zone", I am enjoying coding so much, I can work for hours and not even notice the time passing.
          However, to maximize productivity, my preferred choice is hybrid, flexible annualised hours,
          <span class="weekly-hours">30 hours a week on average</span>.

      <h4>Mental Health</h4>
      <p>
        My mental health problems can be summarised as Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (cPTSD).
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm finding, less events are triggering replays of the trauma.
        This is partly due to changes in my life, effective medication and partly due to knowing the triggers.
        However, I am still capable of replaying trauma once or twice a year, which 
        has the effect of tiring me and loss of concentration. This tends to last one or two weeks
        and will reduce my productivity over those weeks. 
        With flexible working, I can build up hours that can act in lieu of the days when my mental health is poor.

      <h4>Good Working Relationships</h4>
      <p>
        I am warm, friendly, honest and work well within a team.
      </p>
      <p>
        The honesty about my mental health may put off potential employers.
        If the price is it takes longer to find a job, then it is a price worth paying,
        as the job I will get, is one where I can be at my most productive and happy.
        And any employer will be happy with my productivity.
