        <h4>Work Hours</h4>
        <p>
          Keeping timesheets for 18 months has given me a very good idea of my capabilities.
          I can sustain 37.5 hours a week and work up to a maximum 60 hours in any one week.
          When I am in the "zone", I am enjoying coding so much, I can work for hours and not even notice the time passing.
          This is entirely healthy and productive, allowing me to work less when I'm not flying on all cylinders.
          To maximize productivity, my preferred choice is hybrid working, with highly flexible hours.

      <h4>Mental Health</h4>
      <p>
        My mental health problems can be summarised as Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (cPTSD).
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm finding, less events are triggering replays of the trauma.
        This is partly due to changes in my life, effective medication and partly due to knowing the triggers.
        However, I am still capable of replaying trauma once or twice a year, which 
        has the effect of tiring me and loss of concentration. This tends to last one or two weeks
        and will reduce my productivity over those weeks. 
        With flexible working, I can build up hours that can act in lieu of the days when my mental health is poor.
